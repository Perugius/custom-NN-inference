ecg_inference contains script for running the model using the arduino IDE, it is based on manual_tensor_operations_V4

manual_tensor_operations V1-V4 contain the code written for normal c++ execution not for arduino execution. 

for V4 (and ecg_inference) the final dense result does not take into consideration the binary sigmoid function.
